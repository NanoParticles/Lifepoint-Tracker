# Lifepoint-Tracker

Thank you for downloading the Lifepoint Tracker. We're going to start out to point out a few things.

Commands
=========

  The commands on this application are not case senistive. Out of the kindness of my heart, Here are some tips:
  
  You CAN type out any commands using lower case(i.e. "attack monster")
  
  If you choose to captialize something, then your constrained to the first letter of the word. (i.e. "Attack Monster")
  
  You CAN shorten commands and it can be lowercase as well. Vice Versa with it being captialized. (i.e. "Atk", "atk monster")
  
  Name inputs varies. If you have any letter containing a captial letter, then that letter will have to be captialized.
  
  The lifepoint counter has auto-calculations for the battle phase. To disable it, type "options" at the duel menu. Then type "Toggle Damage Calculations". When you navigate back to the duel menu, you can then manually do the calculations for those who wants it off.
  
  Upon completing the duel, you might be navigating back to the duel menu. This feature is not supposed to happen. This is a minor bug that is on the list to squash. Navigate to the options, and determine on how you want to restart the duel.
  
  This lifepoint counter is a work-in-progress, and has been under construction for a few months(3 months to be exact to at least get a most stable build)
  
  I'm working on a working GUI interface. Its going to take awhile to publicly release. When I get all of the features I want to put on the command-line interface, I will then port the various commands that makes this project beating, and running.

This project of mine isn't meant to make money off of. Its free, and open-source. No ifs ands or buts. That's final! If you see things that you wish to modify, or improve upon, be my guest. 

If you want anything to be seen in this lifepoint counter, leave a comment down below at the main repository.
Now with that out of the way, what are you still doing? Don't you have a duel to win?

LETS DUEL!
